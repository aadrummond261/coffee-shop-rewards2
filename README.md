# 🟢 Level 1 — “Open the Shop”

Create a `Customer`.

Fields:

* name
* phoneNumber
* points

Include:

* Default constructor
* Parameterized constructor
* Getters and setters

Create multiple customers.
Let them earn points.
Print their totals.

Nobody starts Gold at Triple C’s.

# 🟡 Level 2 — “Run the Register”

Create a `Purchase` class.

Each item must know:

* itemName
* price
* isDrink

Create at least **6 menu items**.

No arrays.
Just individual object variables.

---

## ☕ Ordering System


The menu must:

* Display at least once
* Allow customers to choose items
* Determine how points are chosen

Update the customer’s points correctly.

---

# 🔴 Level 3 — “Status Matters”

Customers unlock tiers:

* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold

Add redemption:

Free Drink = 100 points

If they don’t have enough → deny
If they do → subtract points

At the end, print:

Name | Tier | Points

Clean. Clear. Professional.

# 🔵 Level 4 — “Make It Feel Like a Real Checkout”

Triple C’s runs smooth.

While the customer is ordering:

* Track their **session total spent**
* Print each item as it’s ordered (like a receipt)

When they finish ordering, print:

* Session total
* Points earned during this session
* Updated total customer points

Make it feel like a real checkout screen.
